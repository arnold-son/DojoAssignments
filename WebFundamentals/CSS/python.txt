First appearing in 1991, Python is a general-purpose, high-level, interpreted
programming language<br>whose design focus emphasizes code readability. Whether
for processing/analyzing<br>data to powering many well-known applications,
Python is not only a great language for new<br>programmers but also powerful
enough for seasoned developers building whatever they can think<br>of.

The Zen of Python

Getting Started

Python can be easy to pick up whether you're<br>a first time programmer or
you're<br>a first time programmer or you're experienced<br>with other languages.
The following pages are<br>a useful first step to get on your way writing<br>
programs with Python!

<ul>
  <li>Beginner's Guide, Programmers</li>
  <li>Beginner's Guide, Non-Programmers</li>
  <li>Code sample and snippets for<br>Beginners</li>
</ul>

Applications

The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts thousands of<br>third-party modules for
Python. Both Python's<br>standard library and the community-<br>contributed
modules allow for endless<br>possibilities.
